// Newton's three laws
// 1. When an object is in motion, it stays in motion until something else acts on it.
// 2. F = MA (force equals mass times acceleration)
// 3. When two objects collide, both objects will experience the same force equal in magnitude but in opposite directions.


// Things we will need. Friction coefficient so that there is a force going against the puck's acceleration so that it slows down.
// Paddle will need some sort of velocity vector as well as acceleration vector. Same thing for Puck.
// I am not sure if we should even consider mass. It'll probably make more sense to have mass because I think we will use force vectors as well.
// MOMENTUM -> INELASTIC COLLISIONS

// Assumptions I make: The paddle is not affected by friction forces.
// We are going to stick with the newtonian system because I don't know what the fuck relativistic and generalized mean
